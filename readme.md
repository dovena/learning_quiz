# Learning Quiz
Since I am back to school after 20 years in a completely new field, I have a hard time remembering all the content for the quizzes. This little learning quiz program helps me to learn. I write the important course content in the JSON file, which can be switched depending on the topic I have to study for.

The questions and the possible answers, plus the correct answer, are written in In a JSON file. It is easy to add new questions as needed in the JSON file.
```json
[
    {
        "question": "Question Title",
        "options": [
            "one",
            "two",
            "three"
        ],
        "answer": "two"
    }
]
```
